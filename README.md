# Bad Word Kata #

This is a Kata from Reddit which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/106gse/9202012_challenge_100_intermediate_bad_word_filter/
)

It simply censors bad words so the initial letter is shown and the rest of the word is stars for example f***. We did this in Android Studio while pairing with TDD and there is a simple Android App as an interface.

### Improvements ###

This is functionally complete but I would like to experiment with this Kata by adding;
* Better UI (not happy with the UI currently but it was done under a time limit)
* adding and implementing RetroLambda
* Potentially using RXJava
